1. Installation of Streamlit
You can install the streamlit framework using the pip tool: pip install streamlit.

You can check if it’s installed by simply viewing the version: streamlit --version. This command should tell you what version the installed streamlit package is. The version information displayed is Streamlit, version 0.89.0 while I’m writing this tutorial.

2. Create the App’s Script
Create a Python script file and let’s simply call it streamlit_sharing.py. Because the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to publish the web app, we’ll keep the stuff in the app minimum. Suppose that the script includes the following lines of code.

3. Launch the App Locally
To launch the app locally, in the terminal, you can run the following command: streamlit run streamlit_sharing.py. Please make sure that you need to navigate to the directory where the Python script is saved. Otherwise, you’ll have to specify the full path to the file.
